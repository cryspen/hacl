# Curve25519

Elliptic-curve Diffie-Hellman key agreement on Curve25519.

## Implementations

There are multiple implementations, i.e., ...

* a portable implementation (`Hacl_Curve25519_51.h`),
* a fast 64-bit implementation that requires BMI2 & ADX CPU support (`Hacl_Curve25519_64.h`), and
* a slower 64-bit implementation without the requirements stated above (`Hacl_Curve25519_64_Slow.h`).

Compute the scalar multiple of a point.

`out` Pointer to 32 bytes of memory, allocated by the caller, where the resulting point is written to.
`priv` Pointer to secret/private key.
`pub` Pointer to public point.

Calculate a public point from a secret/private key.

This computes a scalar multiplication of the secret/private key with the curve's basepoint.

`pub` Pointer to 32 bytes of memory, allocated by the caller, where the resulting point is written to.
`priv` Pointer to secret/private key.

Execute the diffie-hellmann key exchange.

`out` Pointer to 32 bytes of memory, allocated by the caller, where the resulting point is written to.
`priv` Pointer to **our** secret/private key.
`pub` Pointer to **their** public point.
