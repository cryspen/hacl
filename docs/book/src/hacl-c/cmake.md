# CMake

You can include HACL Packages in your CMake project using `FetchContent`.

The `CMakeLists.txt` could look like this.
To use a specific release change the `GIT_TAG` to the release tag.

```
{{#include ../../../../examples/cmake/CMakeLists.txt}}
```

You can find the full example in [examples/cmake].
